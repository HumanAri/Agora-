            "['Amazing place to have on campus food. They are #1 food for last few years for a reason. Tandoor, street food, nori I loved the most. Most of the stalls have halal options. Plenty of beverage options as well too pamper food lovers and students.', 'Most amazing dining experience on a college campus!!!!  There is a reason UMass has had the #1 Dining I. The country for the past 9 years.  Incredible.', 'Amazing food. I work here for my part time so can vouch for the hygiene too.', 'An outstanding food court with incredible variety of food. Food is outstanding and ranks with top restaurants. Students at UMass Amherst are truely spoiled as food was not like that when i was in college. Building is clean and well …', 'Worst dinning halls. Have chicken thigh and only chicken thigh in all dishes, from Ramen to Chinese to Middle Eastern cuisine to Wok. Sushi and Taco stations are closed on weekends.', \"Design over function. One of the best looking dining halls on campus. Unfortunately, it's impossible to find seating during normal eating hours, so have fun walking in circles for 15 minutes before finding a seat. I still go here often because of its convenient location.\", 'mpressed with this dining hub at UMass Amherst. We also ate free because we were the family of a student. They had every kind of food you could want, served buffet style. There was everything from Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, …', 'Always good, way better than any other school and most restaurants.']\n"
